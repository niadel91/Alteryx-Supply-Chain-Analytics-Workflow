# Supply Chain Analytics Workflow using Alteryx

This is a Supply Chain Management challenge.
<br>
<br>
<p>
We have two inputs.  The Historical Data File contains information on a Supplier name, Annual Purchasing Value (APV) and Part Number (PN).  Our second input, the New Demand File, contains data on the forecasted APV)for the PNs that will be demanded.
</p>
<br>
<br>
Generate the Negotiation file for Category Managers so they can use while negotiating new prices with the Suppliers. Match each PN with prior Supplier Names and APV. In order not to duplicate records while joining data, we want to have one column that indicates a case where there was more than one Supplier in the historical data.
